On receipt of a valid MC, the swimmer is entitled to one (1) replacement class.\n\n3.3 Absence (No Replacement): Where a swimmer is absent without valid 24-hour prior notice or a valid MC, the class will be recorded as "provided," credits will be deducted where applicable, and no replacement lesson will be offered.`

  h: '4. School-Initiated Cancellations',

7.2 Medical & Behavioural Declaration: You further declare that, to the best of your knowledge, the swimmer named in this registration:
  (a) does not have any known medical, physical, or psychological condition that would prevent safe participation in swimming lessons;
  (b) has not been advised by a medical professional to refrain from physical activity or aquatic programmes;
  (c) is not under any medication or treatment that would interfere with swim lesson participation;
  (d) does not require additional support unless previously disclosed.

7.3 Disclosure Obligation: Any pre-existing medical condition, allergy, behavioural consideration, or physical limitation must be disclosed to the School prior to the commencement of classes. If any such conditions exist, you confirm that you have disclosed them during registration or will inform the School's administrators before lessons commence.

7.4 Consequences of Non-Disclosure: You understand that failure to disclose relevant medical or behavioural information may affect the safety and quality of instruction and may result in withdrawal from the programme without refund.

7.5 Liability: The School is not liable for injuries or health events arising from undisclosed medical or behavioural conditions.

7.6 Emergency Authorisation: In the event of a medical emergency, the School is authorised to administer basic first aid and to contact emergency services. All reasonable effort will be made to contact the designated emergency contact immediately.`

  body: `9.1 By accepting these Terms, you consent to ${TC_COMPANY} taking photographs and video recordings of the swimmer during lessons, classes, and events for the purposes of instructor training, social media, advertising, school newsletters, and other marketing activities undertaken by the School.

9.2 Opt-Out: If you wish to withhold consent for the use of your swimmer's images in marketing materials, please notify the School in writing at the time of registration or thereafter. The School will then take reasonable steps to exclude the swimmer from marketing photography going forward; this opt-out does not retroactively remove already-published materials.

9.3 This School-led photography consent is distinct from the third-party photography restrictions described in clause 2.4. Visitors and other guardians remain prohibited from photographing or recording any swimmer (including their own child within shared pool areas) without prior written consent from ${TC_COMPANY} and the relevant guardians of every swimmer present.`
